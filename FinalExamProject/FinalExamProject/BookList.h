Description:Serendipity Booksellers is a small bookstore located in a shopping mall. They have a
cashier station equipped with a personal computer. The manager wants you to develop a
point-of-sale (POS) software package that will make the computer function as a cash
register and keep an inventory file. The inventory file will be a database of all the books
in the bookstore. In general, the software is to perform the following tasks:

• Calculate the total of a sale, including sales tax
• When a book is purchased, subtract it from the inventory file
• Add, change, delete, and look up books in the inventory file
• Display various sales reports

Psuedocode:
1. Class BookList is declared.
2. It has private members: bookList vector of Book, filename.
3. It has public members: BookList constructors, add, get, remove, operator[], listBooks, tally, uppercase, writeToFile, readFromFile, getsize,
	findBooks and partailFindBooks methods.
